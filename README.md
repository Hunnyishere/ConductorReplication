# Conductor Replication
This project replicates the functionalities of Conductor from paper ["In-situ Domain Modeling with Fact Routes"](https://personal.traclabs.com/~korten/publications/ICAPS_MARSHAL.pdf) and includes some feature adjustments to make the system more intuitive to use and more generalizable.  

Introduction to this project:  
[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShQdFLgxSx5ml-cz4SZaQnt-tYiED1JS/view?usp=sharing) and [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emvwtPjHVTCR2PoVKsxNZwtALPnkO9we/view?usp=sharing)  

To run this implementation, open a terminal, run "python app.py" in the base directory.  
After you see "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)", open "http://localhost:5000/" on browser to see the tool.  
You can upload files from BlocksWorld and Logistics folders to test the tool.  
(Plan generation in logistics domain might run into some issue due to the limitation of the integrated online parser, just use the existing plan in the folder.)
